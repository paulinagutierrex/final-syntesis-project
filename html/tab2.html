<h3>Special Relativity</h3>
<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>
  It is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time, it deals
  with the movement of bodies in the absence of gravitational forces. Is a
  theory for description of the events that happen in the nature, that is, any
  phenomenon that is can be described by observers.
  <br />
  Was published in 1905 by Albert Einstein<br />
  What he basically postulates is that light travels through empty space at
  300,000 kilometers per second and that nothing is capable of equaling that
  speed, much less exceeding it.
  <br />
  Where Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism were compatible with Newton's
  equations for motion.<br />

<h4>Its postulates are:</h4>
<p>
  1. Laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames <br />
  2. The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers
</p>
<h4>Lorentz transformation</h4>
<p <p>
  Are six parameters of linear transformations of a coordinate frame in
  space-time, relating the measurements of a physical quantity made by two
  different inertial observers
