<h4>What is it?</h4>
<p>
  <br />
  General relativity is a theory of the gravitational field and general
  reference systems, published by Albert Einstein in 1915 and 1916. What was it
  about? The theory of general relativity proposes that the very geometry of
  space-time is affected by the presence of matter, resulting in a relativistic
  theory of the gravitational field. In fact, the theory of general relativity
  predicts that space-time will not be flat in the presence of matter and that
  the curvature of space-time will be perceived as a gravitational field.
  Einstein's basic insight was to postulate that at any certain point one cannot
  experimentally distinguish between a uniformly accelerated body and a uniform
  gravitational field. The general theory of relativity also made it possible to
  reformulate the field of cosmology.
</p>

<h4>Gravity</h4>
<p>
  At the beginning of the 20th century, Albert Einstein developed his general
  theory of relativity, in which he described gravity as a deformation of space
  caused by the presence of massive objects, similar to what happens when a
  heavy ball deforms a rubber strip. <br />

  This deformation "indicates" the smaller objects as they should move through
  space, so that they enter into orbit or fall on the larger astronomical
  object.
  <br /><br />
  This gave rise to a very different way of visualizing space. In the past, it
  was believed that space contained a fluid known as "ether", but when no one
  was able to prove the existence of this substance, humanity began to think
  that space was simply empty.
  <br />
  <br />
  Therefore, Einstein's idea that space was like a fabric structure stretched
  across the universe was revolutionary. He called it the "space-time continuum
  <br />
  <br />
  «Gravity, whose presence was everywhere a body existed, was not a
  force in itself, but geometry, the presence of a body in space deformed
  “space-time” and it was this deformation that attracted the bodies between
  them»

<h4>Space-time</h4>
<p>
  Space and time had their independent identities, and nobody ever got them
  mixed up. It was with the theory of relativity, put together in the early 20th
  century, that talking about space-time became almost unavoidable. In
  relativity, it’s no longer true that space and time have separate, objective
  meanings. What really exists is space-time, and slicing it up into space and
  time is merely a useful human convention.

</p>

<p>
  The Newtonian conception of the universe considers that space and time are
  absolute, which means that they are the same for all those observed regardless
  of their relative motion. Einstein concludes that measurements of space and
  time in relativity depend especially on the relative motion of those observed.
  Moreover, it turned out that space and time are, in fact, intertwined
</p>

<h4>Space-time-curvature</h4>
<p>
  Einstein's equations tell us how space-time is deformed based on how matter
  and energy are distributed over it. In the absence of matter and energy,
  space-time is flat, it has no curvature. This is the so-called Minkowski
  space-time or special relativity. When there is matter/energy, space-time is
  curved, with the highest curvature being in those regions where the
  accumulation of matter/energy is greatest. The most characteristic extreme
  case is that of a black hole, where the matter/energy density and curvature
  can become infinite in some regions.
  <br />
  If we know the geometry associated with a certain distribution of
  matter/energy, Einstein's equations allow us to determine very precisely how
  small changes in that distribution modify the geometry of space-time. These
  small changes are known as "disturbances". In the Solar System, for example,
  the Sun is the dominant source of matter/energy and is primarily responsible
  for the curvature of space.

<h4>Wormhole</h4>
<p>
  In physics, a wormhole, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, is a
  hypothetical structure associated with a space-time whose topology is multiply
  connected,seek to explain how one could travel in space-time

<p>
  This proposal is a theoretical explanation of space-time travel that cannot
  yet be verified. It has not been possible to know about any with existing
  space observation technology so far. On the other hand, science still does not
  have the necessary elements to create a wormhole and experiment with it.
</p>
<h4>Blackhole</h4>
<p>
  A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light
  can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed
  into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can
  get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes
  with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how
  stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars.

  <p/>
  There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and
  miniature. The most commonly known way a black hole forms is by stellar death.
  As stars reach the ends of their lives, most will inflate, lose mass, and then
  cool to form white dwarfs. But the largest of these fiery bodies, those at
  least 10 to 20 times as massive as our own sun, are destined to become either
  super-dense holaaaaa neutron stars or so-called stellar-mass black holes.
