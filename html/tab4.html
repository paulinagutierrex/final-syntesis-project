<h3>
  Travels in time on physics
  <br />
  - GENERAL RELATIVITY -
</h3>
<h4>When does it occur?</h4>
<p>
  Travels in time occur when an object or a person moves in a certain period of
  time, and as we know, for it we use a time machine.

<h4>What is the difference between Space Travel and Time Travel?</h4>
<p>
  The difference between these two is that, space travel takes place over the
  movement of bodies in space and time travel checks on the position of time
  which has an especific moment ocuring.
</p>
<p>
  Outside the usual sense of perception of time; in time travel, is an
  extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of
  special relativity and general relativity. However, making one body advance or
  delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not suitable
  with current technology.
