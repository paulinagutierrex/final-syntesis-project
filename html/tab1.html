<h3>Galilean Relativity</h3>

<h4>
  What is it about?
</h4>
<p>
  Galilean relativity states that the same rules of physics apply in any frame
  of reference that is moving in a straight line at constant speed. basically,
  the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference. Galileo
  Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his Dialogue Concerning the
  Two Chief World Systems using the example of a ship travelling at constant
  velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer below the deck would
  not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary.
</p>

<h3>Galilean Transformations</h3>
<p>
  A Galileo transformation is a change of coordinates and velocities that leaves
  Newton's equations invariant. The previous condition is equivalent to the fact
  that the transformation between the coordinates of an inertial reference
  system and another inertial system that moves with respect to the first is
  also a Galileo transformation. Galileo transformations include the
  transformation equations of position and time, velocity and acceleration
  measured in two inertial time frames. As already stated, these equations allow
  us to establish whether a quantity is invariant when there is a change in
  coordinates.

<h3>u=u´ + v</h3>
<h4>Coordinate transformation:</h4>
<p>
  Galileo Galilei proposed in 1638 that if we have a system (object) 𝐀 in rest,
  and a system (object) 𝐁 in motion, at constant speed respect to the first
  along the positive sense of the 𝐱-axis and if the coordinates of a dot in
  space for 𝐀 are (x,y,z) and for 𝐁 are (x´,y´,z´), a group of coordinate
  transformation equations can be established.

<h4>Transformations of other magnitudes:</h4>
<p>
  Forces and accelerations are changeless under a simple Galileo transformation,
  instead the straight movement transforms in a similar way as the velocity
  vector does.
